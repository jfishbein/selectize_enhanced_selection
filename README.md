# enhanced_selection (selectize.js(https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js) plugin)

See the [Selectize Plugin Docs](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/plugins.md) for general use instructions.

This plugin allows you to select items previously added to the selectize widgit rather than just skipping over them. Its useful if you want screen-reader compliant interactions or want to enable extra events on items and have them be enabled using only the keyboard.

## Usage

```
  $('select').selectize({
    plugins: ['enhanced_selection']
  });
```
